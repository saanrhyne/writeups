### Methodology
We are given a script in .hs, which I learned meant Haskell Script.
According to [FileFormat.com](https://docs.fileformat.com/programming/hs/), Haskell is an advanced purely-functional open-source programming language.
I did a bit of research, and some ChatGPT-ing to understand the syntax, because who likes reading docs? (spoiler alert: nobody). 
It seemed to be essentially a logic challenge, you just needed to figure out which values fit the long list of instructions.


### Solution & Closing Remarks
The flag is **.;,;.{imagine_if_i_made_it_compiled!!!}**.
This was the first challenge I solved (excluding sanity check) , and I was quite happy with myself, especially considering I didn't expect to solve any challenges during this CTF.
